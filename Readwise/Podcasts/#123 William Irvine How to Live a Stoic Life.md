    - Note: A good approach to Stoic.
- Speaker 0: visualization says once you've found your thing to think about. Now, I want you to imagine that you don't have the thing that you take for ([Time 0:23:01](https://www.airr.io/quote/61b4c3523aae6012c85f40ef))
    - Note: negative visualization
- Speaker 0: can't change them. So to spend your time and energy worrying about them is a waste of your time and energy. And it's a profound insight. Uh you know some people are anxious, some people are not but the people who are anxious often it's because they're concerning themselves with things they can't control. And uh so an important insight. So focus your attention on things you can control. And I mentioned that among the things you can control are your ([Time 0:28:47](https://www.airr.io/quote/61b4c3523aae6012c85f4107))
    - Note: Focus on controllable.
- Speaker 0: The setbacks themselves can be tiny little things like somebody making an offhanded remark about your appearance or about something you did. That's the setback. And then what what does the harm is you dwelling on that you tossing and turning on that? And that's an important insight that it's self inflicted harm when setbacks hurt us. Most of the harm is self inflicted and it's us letting that flood of negative emotions take us ([Time 0:35:16](https://www.airr.io/quote/61b4c3523aae6012c85f4140))
    - Note: Negative emotions from failure.

A lot of people undervalue self discipline, you know, you're so straight and always doing what you want to do, but when you think about it in a different sense, self discipline means what it means, you are controlling the one life that you have to live. And then the follow up question is so if you're not controlling that life, who or what is and why would you allow something else to control the one life you have to live? What a ([Time 0:48:38](https://www.airr.io/quote/61b4c4a43aae6012c85fce19))
    - Note: Why discipline?
- Speaker 0: very important that you invest quality time into thinking about what your options are and that can involve a degree of brainstorming. There's no guarantee you're going to pick the optimal option, you can put all the thought you want. But one thing's for sure, and that is that if you don't even consider the optimal option, there's no way you can pick it. ([Time 0:58:46](https://www.airr.io/quote/61b4c7743aae6012c8626371))
- Speaker 0: imagine somebody who is open minded but not skeptical before you knew it there, their mind would be full of conspiracy theories and all sorts of strange stuff because there'll be all sorts of ideas flowing in without filter. Okay now imagine the opposite of that, somebody who was skeptical, highly skeptical but not open minded. So that person would end up basically with true and useful beliefs because that skeptical guard would only let those in, but there'll be all sorts of other beliefs that are both true and useful that he simply wouldn't open himself to.

    - Note: Open-minded vs Skeptical
