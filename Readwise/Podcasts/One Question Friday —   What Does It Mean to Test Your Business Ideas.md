## Highlights
- How to Test an Idea
  So you do what's called a problem interview. You just talk to them about their life. You ask them questions. You try to see, A. is this a real problem for them? B. how big of a problem is it? Like do this is the biggest issue in my life right now? Or, that's nice to have. And you can suss that out by trying to figure out, ok, so what have you done to try to solve this? And if they don't really say anything, well, then it's probably not actualy that big o a problem. They haven't been trying to solve it. If they've tried like eight solutions and none of it's working and they're just banging their heads against the wall, you know it's a real problem.
