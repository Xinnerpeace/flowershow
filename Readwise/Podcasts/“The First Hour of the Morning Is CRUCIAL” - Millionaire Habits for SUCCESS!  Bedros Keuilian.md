## Highlights
- I'm Adopting That
  Summary:
  There's a gift to just being, for lack of a better term, ignorant. It is hard to explain, but sometimes you don't need an explanation. For example, if you just watch what winners do and do what they do odds are you will eventually have a similar outcome. And so when I look up to you in this category of life, I'm gonna do that.

  It is hard to explain, but sometimes you don't need an explanation. For example, if you just watch what winners do and do what they do odds are you will eventually have a similar outcome. Great example is I believe you may have shared this at either Fleishman's elevator nights when we all spoke there, or might have been on when you were kind enough to come and do my podcast. But you said, if I wake up with, correct me if I'm wrong, if I wake up within 20 minutes of my alarm going off, I don't go back to sleep, I just get up. I'm like, I'm adopting that, I'm adopting that. Now, if it was some crack head who Rob's Banks says that, I may not adopt that. But you're someone I respect that I want to be like and emulate, you know what? I'm gonna add that to my repertoire. Like, I don't know why Sean wrote in his book that you need to drink third ounce of water in the morning. I don't care why, I trust him. And I trust that he's a great scientist and he's all about human optimization. I'm gonna do that. I trust you as an entrepreneur. And so when I look up to you in this category of life, I'm gonna do that. And so I just started adopting things. And I think there's a gift to just being, for lack of a better term, ignorant. Like, you know, ignorance is bliss. ([Time 0:07:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/31b25fce-32d0-489f-8ec6-294f091cd57e))

- I Will Never Experience Failure
  Summary:
  I learned from Napoleon Hill's book Outwitting the Devil that there is no such thing as failure. I have reframed it in my head as I will experience temporary defeat many times in my life, but I will never experience failure. Why? What's failure? Why won't you experience failure? Failure is a choice. The moment you choose to stay down because of not trying, you have given up. So is failure when you actually stop trying? It's when you stop trying. And it's OK to stay down and gather your wits and then get back up - hence making it temporary defeat.

  Speaker 1
  So I'll start with the idea of failure first. And I learned from Napoleon Hill's book Outwitting the Devil that there is no such thing as failure. I have reframed it in my head as I will experience temporary defeat many times in my life. But I will never experience failure. And once you accept that. Why? What's failure? Why won't you experience failure? Failure is a choice. And so if you choose not to, if you choose not to drink any more water from that cup, no matter how much I make you, you choose not to drink it, it's not going to happen.
  Speaker 2
  So is failure when you actually stop trying?
  Speaker 1
  It's when you stop trying. It's a choice to stay down. And it's OK to stay down and gather your wits and then get back up, hence making it temporary defeat. The moment you choose to stay down because of not trying, you have given up. ([Time 0:14:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5849cd99-ed1c-4ab4-b133-b40500782ba4))
    - Note: There’s no such thing as failure, only temporary defeats and give-ups.
