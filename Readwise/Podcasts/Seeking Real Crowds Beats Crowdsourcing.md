## Highlights
- I Crowdsource When I Should Have Looked for a Crowd
  Summary:
  I was in Bucatinyi, Indonesia, the island of Sumatra. I wanted to have Rendong, which is this great, you know, local minicabao dish. TripAdvisor found a restaurant that had great reviews, but they were all tourist bus reviews. So if in doubt, fall back on those old human things: be willing to be lonely and lost... Follow your smell instead of following an app recommendation.

  Well, now it's like you could not leave your home while experiencing the world. You know, you can basically be sitting the same silly text to your same silly friends, looking at your same social media friends, trying to find, you know, to crowdsource, using your phone to crowdsource a restaurant instead of just looking for a crowd. I wrote a, there's a chapter in the book about this. I was in Bucatinyi, Indonesia, the island of Sumatra. And I wanted to have Rendong, which is this great, you know, local minicabao dish. And I went to TripAdvisor, I think, and I found a restaurant and I went there and had great reviews, but they were all tourist bus reviews. And the tourist bus wasn't there yet. And so the Rendong was okay, but not great. I realized I'd walked through a market full of Bucatinyi natives, having the time of their lives eating at the market. And it's like, I crowdsource when I should have looked for a crowd. There's a little human crowd in the street eating food and I crowdsource it through my phone. So if in doubt, fall back on those old human things, be willing to be lonely and lost and a little bit bored and to follow your smell to the good restaurant, to follow a crowd to a good restaurant instead of following an app recommendation. And again, it's easier said than done. And I think some, you know, Gen Z people will think, Oh my gosh, that sounds really weird.
