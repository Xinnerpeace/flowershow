  - The speaker chooses to surround themselves with people who share their foundational values

  Speaker 1
  I think honesty is a core, core, core value. To give you examples of what I mean by honesty is I want to be able to just be me. I never want to be in an environment around people where I have to watch what I say because if I disconnect what I'm thinking from what I'm saying that creates multiple threads in my mind, that means that I'm no longer in the moment. That means that I now have to work future planning or past regretting every time I'm talking to somebody. So anyone around whom I can't be fully honest, I don't want to be around. Another example of foundational value is I don't believe in any short-term thinking or dealing. So if I see anybody who's even around me, like let's say I'm doing business with somebody and they think in a short-term manner with somebody else, then I don't want to do business without person anymore because I think all the benefits in life come from compound interest, whether in money or in relationships or love or health or activities or habits. So I only want to be around people that I know I'm going to be around for the rest of my life. And I only want to work on things that I know have the long-term payout. Another one is I only believe in peer relationships. I don't believe in hierarchical relationships. So I don't want to be above anybody and I don't want to be below anybody. If I can't treat someone like a peer and if they can't treat me like a peer, then I just don't want to interact with that human.

      2. Long-term
      3. Peer relationship
- Issues with the Current Education System
  Key takeaways:
  - Learning should be about understanding the basics in all fields and mastering them before advanced topics
  - The education system needs to keep up with practical skills such as nutrition, cooking, healthy relationships, and technology
  - The pace of learning is an issue in the current education system

  Speaker 1
  When I see that symbol, I do this. But now you've lost the actual learning, you've lost the connection to the underlying principles. So I think learning should be about learning the basics in all the fields, and learning them really well over and over, because life is mostly about applying the basics and only doing the advanced stuff in the things that you truly love and where you understand the basics inside out. But that's not how our system is built. We teach all these kids calculus, and they walk out understanding calculus at all, when really they would have been better off-served just doing arithmetic and basic computer programming the entire time. So I think there's a pace of learning issue. And then there's finally a what to learn, and there's a whole set of things we don't even bother trying to teach. We don't teach nutrition. We don't teach cooking. We don't teach how to be in happy, positive relationships. We don't teach how to keep your body healthy and fit. We just say sports. We don't teach happiness. We don't teach meditation. Maybe we shouldn't teach some of these things, because different kids will have different attitudes, but maybe we should. Maybe we should teach practical construction of technology and maybe everyone in their science project, instead of building a little chemistry volcano, maybe you should be building a smartphone. So we just haven't kept up. And I have to believe that we can change the system, ([Time 1:08:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e1c87525-7329-4ffa-b7c3-0544a4b19a79))
- How Do You Determine if You Can Trust Someone?
  Key takeaways:
  - Intelligence, energy, and integrity are Warren Buffet's criteria for evaluating people
  - Integrity usually comes out in either a long-term way or a short-term way by observing how they treat other people
  - People with internal moral compasses don't do bad deals with other people since it would compromise their own views of themselves
  - Negotiations with high-integrity people are usually smooth
  - People who talk too much about their values or themselves are often covering something up

  Buffett's criteria for evaluating people, which is the combination of intelligence, energy and integrity. What predictive signals do you pay attention to for each? How do you determine if you can trust someone?
  Speaker 1
  A large part of your job is just one. That's the hardest one. Integrity is the hardest one and integrity usually comes out in two ways. One is long term, which is just you've known somebody for a while and you kind of know how to think about things. But the most, the more interesting one, there's a short term one, which is you just kind of see how they treat other people. So there are lots and lots of people who will not screw over, screw over just a strong word, but they will do something that is self-feeling or slightly unethical relative to another business partner. But the whole time they'll say to you, naj naj naj naj nwing gwing, I'm taking advantage of the person because they deserve it. But you're my friend, I would never do that to you.
  Speaker 2
  Of course so.
  Speaker 1
  And the thing is, yeah, exactly. It's very easy to change your definition of who friends are. I find that the people who really do it, things out of integrity, they have an internal moral compass. So they don't do unfair unethical or bad deals with other people because it would soil their own view of themselves and they wouldn't be able to sleep with themselves at night. So some of the highest integrity people I know, the worst thing you can do is you can say to them, well, I think you're self-feeling on that one. And they will get so unhappy because they'll be like, no, no, no, that's not who I am. I can't be that person and they'll bend over backwards. Usually I find that people that are negotiate with who are high integrity, they're very easy to negotiate with. They'll give you things that they don't need to give you because they think it's fair and vice versa. So negotiations with high integrity people are usually very easy. You're giving each other things to make sure the other person is happy enough that the deal survives because unhappy deals get unquammed and they become short-term relationships which don't have any compounding benefits. And then finally, if someone is going around and talking about how honest they are, they're probably dishonest. It's just like a little telltale indicator of learn. When someone spends too much time talking about their own values or talking themselves up, they're covering for something.

- I just had this saying inside my head, the closer you want to get to me, the better your values have to be. ([Time 1:34:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1c1d5b78-7b07-4eb2-9f42-b405bf072396))
