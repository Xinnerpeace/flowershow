## Highlights
- What's the Biggest Risk to You?
  Summary:
  The risk of having something that's just okay is not bad enough to obviously fail, nor is it good enough to be amazing. And so the risk is that you're wasting your most valuable asset, your time on something that is not great. In what way are you just settling for a bad relationship or a just okay job, a just okay level of traction at your startup? That is one risk.

  And in actuality, at least for most people in America, that's not that painful of a risk. You waste a little bit of time, but it failed. You know, crashed and burned and you can move on and you learned a lesson and you have a story to tell and you might have met some people along the way. You build some skills. And so you actually don't take that much risk doing it and you generally will, you know, not put too much money into something at that stage. So that's one version of failing with us, let's say a startup or a job. But the other version that I think is much more sneaky and much more, much plagues, many more people is mediocrity, which is the risk of having something that's just okay. It's not bad enough to obviously fail, nor is it good enough to be amazing. And so the risk is that you're wasting your most valuable asset, your time on something that is not great. And so for you, listen to this podcast, you're the type of person that wants greatness out of your life, then with the biggest risk to you is mediocrity. Because failing is fine. You'll just try another thing. You'll try something else. But something that's just all right, it's not great, but not bad enough to fail is going to deprive you of your most valuable asset, your time. So mediocrity is the first flavor of risk to identify. In what way are you just settling for a bad relationship or a just okay relationship, a just okay job, a just okay level of traction at your startup? That is one risk.
