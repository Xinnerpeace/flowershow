## Highlights
- Speaker 0: So my advice to the regular listener reader person, the person like me is honestly go to real media for your information, go to social media for your play. ([Time 0:38:13](https://www.airr.io/quote/61b747553aae6012c87ff751))
    - Note: Social media vs Real media
- Speaker 0: can, if you're really tough skinned, you can post something to the public, knowing there are hundreds of thousands of people and bots on there who are going to use your inquiry to hurt you. That that's their intent, right? To make you feel bad about yourself, to undermine your sense of authority, to get you to join something that's terrible to militarize you to send it, make you more cynical, as long as you understand that, right? That the vast majority of people replying to you and looking at you and using the information you're putting out, are using it to hurt you, to reduce your autonomy, um to make you feel bad about yourself, to create mental illnesses, to distort your perception of reality as long as you know that ([Time 0:38:59](https://www.airr.io/quote/61b747553aae6012c87ff784))
- Speaker 0: is really good. Obviously it's a database technology, the whole internet. So it's really good at breaking us. It's optimized for breaking us down that way and it's not optimized for the, the heterogeneous community thing that you're talking about. The heterogeneous community really only works in real life where you have a broad enough bandwidth to engage with people who are really different from you online. It works really better to go find that group of people that you can't find in real ([Time 0:44:50](https://www.airr.io/quote/61b749423aae6012c8815f5f))
    - Note: Internet break people down. And it is more useful to find communities otherwise hard to find.
- Speaker 0: in an email to 
  Speaker 1: me before this, you said you were sort of in an anti business anti self optimization with these days. Why? 
  Speaker 0: Because I feel like we're trying to auto tune ourselves. You know, we're living in a digital media environment where everything is quantized. You know, it's either here or there. You're on this this node or that node. And our value system accordingly is to get people either, you know, up to the sea or down to the B but not in that weird squishy place in between. You know, fuzzy logic is about reducing, its not about maintaining the fuzziness. You know, it's about you're here or you're there and you need more granularity. Okay? We'll give you a half step. You're here here here here here here or here. All right. You don't like that will give you six. Will give you eight. But you're still always on the mark. And what we do by doing that is we make a judgment as to what is signal and what is noise. You know, if you're going to auto tune James Brown, right? James Brown reaching up for the note or coming down in over the note? No, no, you're gonna auto tune. And he's not reaching He's on the note. On the note. What have you done? You filed off the soul? The signal in a James Brown recording the actual signal is the is his soul reaching up for that note? That's why they call it Soul. It's that reaching that we're hearing. That's what makes his interpretation of the song different than Brittany's different than Ariana's we auto tune everybody in our music. We're tending toward auto tuning everybody uh, in in their lives, you know, the metric and this is all the metric you put on the wall is the metric that you're going to get. You know, and it may not be an ideal single focus for more than just some provisional fun ([Time 0:52:11](https://www.airr.io/quote/61b74a193aae6012c8819c24))
    - Note: Auto-tune.
- Speaker 0: the only thing that I remembered from it was they distinguish between a decision and a choice and I really that that like a decision is the process of I have this decision to make, it's the unresolved thing. The decision is more like the question, the weighing after this decision, the choice is what you autonomously choose to do 
  Speaker 1: without sort of an evaluation or a rigorous process. 
  Speaker 0: Well there can be there can do the evaluation and then make a choice, but once I make the choice, what I've learned now is to stop, second guess is to stop going back to decision. You know, what would've could've should've what about that one? What about that? I chose this one, this is what's what I chose, I chose the frog, Amapa cheapo madonnina from, you know, whatever the thing is at Starbucks, you know, I just choose black coffee, but whatever I chose that one. Oh, I could have got the decaf latte chopped you're chopped chicken. Yeah, you could have, you could have but this is what you're here now, this is your house, this is your car, this is your wife, this is your shirt, you know, that's it. And I, and I feel like it benefits advertisers and certain companies to get people second guessing all their choices, so put them back in decision mode, so they buy more stuff and it's like, you know, you really don't, you don't need it. You don't, it's really fine. I think we're wasting a lot of time and energy re choosing things that don't matter. ([Time 1:03:20](https://www.airr.io/quote/61b74c543aae6012c883d26c))
    - Note: Re-choose.
