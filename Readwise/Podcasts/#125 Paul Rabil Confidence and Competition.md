## Highlights
- Speaker 1: How do you maintain that level of work ethic and dedication and love for the sport through the grind through the years? 
  Speaker 0: Yeah, it's, I think a lot of it is an eight to be honest and it's a dangerous path because to have that endless competitive streak, you've got to have a fire in your belly morning, noon and night. And that's hard to reconcile with because most of the time in sport, most of the time in life you fail. And so those that have that competitive streak in that desire to be the best and that relentlessness, the doggedness. Um they also sit in that seemingly black hole of failure more than others, but that's also why they come out better more than others. And so you need therapy, you need like good sports psychology And the trait that I'm describing two is really the 1% of the 1% and you know it when you see that competitive, because it's kind of a competitive asshole is what you have to become in sports at least. And what I've learned in business and in life is you've got to be a competitive compromiser and that requires kindness, empathy, ingenuity, but the same level of aggressive competitive spirit, but it's shifted in sports, it's binary, you can just tackle someone and win, can't do that in ([Time 0:10:10](https://www.airr.io/quote/61b4a3333aae6012c8438f3e))
    - Note: How to maintain high level of work ethic?
- Speaker 0: the unknown for me at the time of the trick in a way is that I never, I never focused on getting too far ahead of where I was at the time and the time for me and the lessons in sport. It's really, really meditative. It's being present and completing the task at hand to the best of your ability. So whether that was like every day against the wall, shooting on that, I would have this approach that I wouldn't stop until I felt like I got as close to perfect as possible. So it wasn't like timed, it wasn't a number of reps, it was just out there because I wanted to be great. ([Time 0:19:19](https://www.airr.io/quote/61b4a3333aae6012c8438f6d))
    - Note: The mental of being the greatest.
- Speaker 0: I believe that I was. Um and there were probably guys that thought that they worked harder than me, but they, but they may be only thought of it linearly. They worked harder than me in the weight room then work hard with me maybe on the field. But why, why I think that my meter was always full is I never stopped thinking ([Time 0:21:07](https://www.airr.io/quote/61b4a3333aae6012c8438f9c))
    - Note: Work hard in different dimensions.
- Speaker 0: as a hard charging professional athlete that's in a contact sport, you always have to take care of your body sleep. Number one hydrate, number two, eat number three, stay on your workouts, Number four, Stay on Your ([Time 0:25:33](https://www.airr.io/quote/61b4a3f53aae6012c8445347))
    - Note: Priorities to stay athletically competitive.
- Speaker 0: I think what makes sports great is that you can have a poor game and then use the week to recalibrate. So you go back and you practice and then you get the benefit of time, which time is a healing mechanism To do that in the, in a 60 minute game is a lot more difficult requires. I think a high level of mental attitude. Um, and, and mental training. So I'll give you one example, it's called a rebound ([Time 0:32:07](https://www.airr.io/quote/61b4a6653aae6012c8464ea2))
    - Note: Rebound goal.
- Speaker 0: I do think that mentally elevating doubt and fear is probably the better way to describe how these top athletes think their, their fear motivated fear of not being the best fear of losing and, and fear of not ([Time 0:36:16](https://www.airr.io/quote/61b4a6653aae6012c8464eb4))
    - Note: Best motivators.
