## Highlights
- How I Got My First 10,000 Subscribers
  Summary:
  "I don't think you should grow an audience for the sake of growing an audience," he said. "The audience is basically a byproduct of you doing something else you really want to do"

  Speaker 3
  And then I just decided, OK, the first content I create is just going to be content that they love because if they love it, they'll share it. They'll kind of endorse it and that'll drive a bunch of growth right away of the right audience. And so what he did was he's like, OK, they have this. They need data. They need visualizations. They need charts. Cool.
  Speaker 1
  So I'm just going to do or they need transcripts like quick transcripts of like what Trump just said.
  Speaker 3
  They need to have like the edited, well formatted transcript. So he's like, we weren't doing our own opinions and analysis. No, I would just sit there and I would live when Trump was talking.
  Speaker 1
  I'm transcribing it. I clean it up. I format it. I have the first to post Trump said this. And then those guys would retweet it. And that's how I got my first like 10,000 subscribers is I can after you get 10,000, there's psychologically the thing where you'll just start growing faster because people want to follow popular accounts.
  Speaker 2
  Well, what was your advice though to these people on growing an audience? My advice was pretty simple.
  Speaker 3
  I go, I don't think you should grow an audience for the sake of growing an audience. The audience is basically a byproduct of you doing something else you really want to do.
  Speaker 1
  Like if you just got that itch, you want to scratch like, I want to create content. Like I've seen YouTubers. I think I could do it. That's actually a better reason to go do it than if I can get to a million subscribers, then I'll upsell my merch to this percentage of them and I can make this much money.
  Speaker 3
  It's like, don't do the calculating way to do it. ([TimeÂ 0:19:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0597024d-db10-4fde-98d0-e5114cd38759))
