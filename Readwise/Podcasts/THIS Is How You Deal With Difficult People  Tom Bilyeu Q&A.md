When you do that, you'll be surprised how that changes the energy between the two of you. That's what i call just sit. Just sit with the person. Don't try to change them. Don't worry about what they think about you. Just sit, just be, and that's it. Then all the toxicity that they have cannot permeate your mind.

  And i can do what they call loving kindness, which sounds really cheesy, but when you look at meditators who practise loving kindness, it has a profound psychological, but also physiological impact on the brain. So just be compassionate, have empathy, fill your heart with love for that person and whatever they're going through. And honesly, when you do that, you'll be surprised, maybe not in the immediate term, but you'll be surprised, on a long enough time scale, how that changes the energy between the two of you. It's what i call just sit. Just sit with the person. Just be with them. Don't try to change them. Don't worry about what they think about you. Just sit, just be, and that's it. Then all the toxicity that they have cannot permeate your mind. ([TimeÂ 0:08:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4c3919ec-9505-41e8-86db-759b9b043863))
