## Highlights
- Organizations say they want insights and they want innovation and they really don't, but they're being serious, they think they want insights, but insights are dis-organizing as you point out insights make you change the way you think make you change all kinds of things and you know, they may not be right.
  So most organizations actually inhibit insights when people bring up new ideas, they tend to stifle them, that's a big problem. ([Time 0:09:49](https://www.airr.io/quote/62f8f90369ae325222b441bf))
    - Note: Organize blocks insights coz it would change something.
- Speaker 0: which ones worked and which ones didn't. Now some decisions may have been good decisions that didn't work through, no fault of the employee and some may have been bad decisions that worked because the employee got lucky. So you can't just look at the outcome but you have to look at what what was the person thinking about when they made the decision and what can we learn whether it was a success or a failure.

- Speaker 1: it as well as you thought or you know where to go look for a different piece of information to more effectively complete your understanding of it or offer more value. And the other benefit to doing it is that you can look back in the past and you can sort of like figure out patterns in your decisions, 
  Speaker 0: right? Both of those are important issues. The act of journaling is, is a way of helping you inquire better and be curious about things that you haven't thought about. Yes, all of those are all of the above. I would like to see the decision journal when we're finished here. 
  Speaker 1: Awesome. I think we're actually gonna publish one that people can buy on amazon and right at some point this year, maybe I'll get you to look that over before ([Time 0:28:56](https://www.airr.io/quote/62f9d0bb69ae325222d06500))
