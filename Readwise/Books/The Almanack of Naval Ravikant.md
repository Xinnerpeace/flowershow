## Highlights
- For my parents, who gave me everything and always seem to find a way to give more
- There are lots of miserable “successful” people out there. Be careful about modeling those, as you will get all the bathwater with the baby.
- There was a lot of hardship, but everyone goes through hardship. It did help me in a number of ways.
- If you have nothing in your life, but you have at least one person that loves you unconditionally, it’ll do wonders for your self-esteem.
- Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it. It is much more about understanding than purely hard work. Yes, hard work matters, and you can’t skimp on it. But it has to be directed in the right way. 
  If you don’t know yet what you should work on, the most important thing is to figure it out. You should not grind at a lot of hard work until you figure out what you should be working on.
- Making money is not a thing you do—it’s a skill you learn.
- Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.
- Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.
- Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.
- Technology democratizes consumption but consolidates production. The best person in the world at anything gets to do it for everyone.
- No one can compete with you on being you. 
  Most of life is a search for who and what needs you the most.
- “Escape competition through authenticity.” Basically, when you’re competing with people, it’s because you’re copying them. It’s because you’re trying to do the same thing. But every human is different. Don’t copy.
- If you go to the library and there’s a book you cannot understand, you have to dig down and say, “What is the foundation required for me to learn this?” Foundations are super important.
- Compound interest also happens in your reputation. If you have a sterling reputation and you keep building it for decades upon decades, people will notice. Your reputation will literally end up being thousands or tens of thousands of times more valuable than somebody else who was very talented but is not keeping the compound interest in reputation going.
- when you find the 1 percent of your discipline which will not be wasted, which you’ll be able to invest in for the rest of your life and has meaning to you—go all-in and forget about the rest.
- Embrace accountability and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.
- If it entertains you now but will bore you someday, it’s a distraction. Keep looking.
- One form of leverage is labor—other humans working for you. It is the oldest form of leverage, and actually not a great one in the modern world. [1] I would argue this is the worst form of leverage that you could possibly use. Managing other people is incredibly messy. It requires tremendous leadership skills. You’re one short hop from a mutiny or getting eaten or torn apart by the mob.
- Now, you can multiply your efforts without involving other humans and without needing money from other humans.
- The final form of leverage is brand new—the most democratic form. It is: “products with no marginal cost of replication.” This includes books, media, movies, and code. Code is probably the most powerful form of permissionless leverage.
- In customer service, unfortunately, inputs and outputs relate relatively close to each other, and the hours you put in matter.
- Real estate agent is a job with input and output disconnected.
- Each level has increasing leverage, increasing accountability, increasingly specific knowledge.
- I would love to be paid purely for my judgment, not for any work. I want a robot, capital, or computer to do the work, but I want to be paid for my judgment.
- We waste our time with short-term thinking and busywork. Warren Buffett spends a year deciding and a day acting. That act lasts decades.
- Just from being marginally better, like running a quarter mile a fraction of a second faster, some people get paid a lot more—orders of magnitude more. Leverage magnifies those differences even more. Being at the extreme in your art is very important in the age of leverage.
- I think the best way to stay away from this constant love of money is to not upgrade your lifestyle as you make money
- I believe deep down we all know who we are. You cannot hide anything from yourself. Your own failures are written within your psyche, and they are obvious to you. If you have too many of these moral shortcomings, you will not respect yourself. The worst outcome in this world is not having self-esteem. If you don’t love yourself, who will? 
  I think you just have to be very careful about doing things you are fundamentally not going to be proud of, because they will damage you.
- People are oddly consistent. Karma is just you, repeating your patterns, virtues, and flaws until you finally get what you deserve.
- One of the things I think is important to make money is having a reputation that makes people do deals through you.
- You don’t get rich by spending your time to save money. 
  You get rich by saving your time to make money.
- Can you define judgment? 
  My definition of wisdom is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions. Wisdom applied to external problems is judgment.
- the smartest people can explain things to a child. If you can’t explain it to a child, then you don’t know it.
- What we wish to be true clouds our perception of what is true. Suffering is the moment when we can no longer deny reality.
- The more desire I have for something to work out a certain way, the less likely I am to see the truth. Especially in business, if something isn’t going well, I try to acknowledge it publicly and I try to acknowledge it publicly in front of my co-founders and friends and co-workers. Then, I’m not hiding it from anybody else. If I’m not hiding it from anybody, I’m not going to delude myself from what’s actually going on.
- Our egos are constructed in our formative years—our first two decades. They get constructed by our environment, our parents, society. Then, we spend the rest of our life trying to make our ego happy. We interpret anything new through our ego: “How do I change the external world to make it more how I would like it to be?”
- I used to identify as libertarian, but then I would find myself defending positions I hadn’t really thought through because they’re a part of the libertarian canon. If all your beliefs line up into neat little bundles, you should be highly suspicious.
- Maybe you’re a competitive athlete, and you get injured badly, like Bruce Lee. You have to accept being an athlete is not your entire identity, and maybe you can forge a new identity as a philosopher.
