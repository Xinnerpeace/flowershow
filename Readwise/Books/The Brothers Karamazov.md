## Highlights
- Immediately after the elopement Adelaïda Ivanovna discerned in a flash that she had no feeling for her husband but contempt.
- As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much more naïve and simple-hearted than we suppose. And we ourselves are, too.
- He would perhaps have really gone; but having determined to do so he felt at once entitled to fortify himself for the journey by another bout of reckless drinking.
- Fyodor Pavlovitch was all his life fond of acting, of suddenly playing an unexpected part, sometimes without any motive for doing so, and even to his own direct disadvantage, as, for instance, in the present case. This habit, however, is characteristic of a very great number of people, some of them very clever ones, not like Fyodor Pavlovitch.
- so terrible were her sufferings from the caprice and everlasting nagging of this old woman, who was apparently not bad-hearted but had become an insufferable tyrant through idleness.
- Making her feel that she had "wronged" him, he took advantage of her phenomenal meekness and submissiveness to trample on the elementary decencies of marriage.

- the boy's genius should be trained by a teacher of genius.
