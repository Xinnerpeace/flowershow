## Highlights
- Despite my lackluster high school career, I still believed I could become a great player. And I knew that if things were going to improve, I was the one responsible for making it happen. ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=134))
- I wasn’t going to be starting on the baseball team anytime soon, so I focused on getting my life in order. While my peers stayed up late and played video games, I built good sleep habits and went to bed early each night. In the messy world of a college dorm, I made a point to keep my room neat and tidy. These improvements were minor, but they gave me a sense of control over my life. I started to feel confident again. And this growing belief in myself rippled into the classroom as I improved my study habits and managed to earn straight A’s during my first year.

- A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in many cases, automatically. As each semester passed, I accumulated small but consistent habits that ultimately led to results that were unimaginable to me when I started.

- We all face challenges in life. This injury was one of mine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=155))
- It was a gradual evolution, a long series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs. The only way I made progress—the only choice I had—was to start small. ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=161))
- The backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue, craving, response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps. ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=193))
- Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesn’t move much. If you work late tonight and ignore your family, they will forgive you. If you procrastinate and put your project off until tomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later. A single decision is easy to dismiss. ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=268))
- Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=284))
- Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=289))
- each book you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=299))
- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=407))
- The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=482))
- You don’t need a unanimous vote to win an election; you just need a majority. It doesn’t matter if you cast a few votes for a bad behavior or an unproductive habit. Your goal is simply to win the majority of the time. ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=550))
    - Note: No pressure if acted bad occasionally.
- The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself. ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=589))
- Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=634))
- Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=637))
- How to Create a Good Habit The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious. The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive. The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy. The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying. ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=760))
