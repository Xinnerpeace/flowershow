## Highlights
- There’s a saying in Texas: “The smallest dog barks the loudest.” A confident man doesn’t feel a need to prove that he’s confident. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=243))
- The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=302))
- As the existential philosopher Albert Camus said (and I’m pretty sure he wasn’t on LSD at the time): “You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.” ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=313))
- Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires. The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure. Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=329))
- Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent, it means being comfortable with being different. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=370))
- Subtlety #2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=404))
- when a person has no problems, the mind automatically finds a way to invent some. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=419))
- life itself is a form of suffering. The rich suffer because of their riches. The poor suffer because of their poverty. People without a family suffer because they have no family. People with a family suffer because of their family. People who pursue worldly pleasures suffer because of their worldly pleasures. People who abstain from worldly pleasures suffer because of their abstention. This isn’t to say that all suffering is equal. Some suffering is certainly more painful than other suffering. But we all must suffer nonetheless. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=502))
- True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving. ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=581))
- we shouldn’t always trust our own emotions. In fact, I believe we should make a habit of questioning them. ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=615))
- The person you marry is the person you fight with. The house you buy is the house you repair. The dream job you take is the job you stress over. Everything comes with an inherent sacrifice—whatever makes us feel good will also inevitably make us feel bad. ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=630))
- What is the pain that you want to sustain? ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=666))
- The truth is, I thought I wanted something, but it turns out I didn’t. End of story. I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love with not the fight but only the victory. And life doesn’t work that way. Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for. ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=685))
- our values determine the nature of our problems, and the nature of our problems determines the quality of our lives. ([Location 1089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1089))
    - Note: 价值观决定问题,问题决定人生。
- What is objectively true about your situation is not as important as how you come to see the situation, how you choose to measure it and value it. Problems may be inevitable, but the meaning of each problem is not. We get to control what our problems mean based on how we choose to think about them, the standard by which we choose to measure them. ([Location 1141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1141))
- If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success. ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1183))
- good, healthy values are achieved internally. ([Location 1287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1287))
    - Note: 健康的价值观受自己掌控,不健康的则由外部决定。
- This, in a nutshell, is what “self-improvement” is really about: prioritizing better values, choosing better things to give a fuck about. Because when you give better fucks, you get better problems. And when you get better problems, you get a better life. ([Location 1309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1309))
- When we feel that we’re choosing our problems, we feel empowered. When we feel that our problems are being forced upon us against our will, we feel victimized and miserable. ([Location 1334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1334))
- Nobody else is ever responsible for your situation but you. Many people may be to blame for your unhappiness, but nobody is ever responsible for your unhappiness but you. This is because you always get to choose how you see things, how you react to things, how you value things. ([Location 1439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1439))
    - Note: Input-Process-Output
      最重要的是 大脑处理信息的能力
- accepting the inevitable imperfections of our values is necessary for any growth to take place. Instead of striving for certainty, we should be in constant search of doubt: ([Location 1683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1683))
- here’s something that’s weird but true: we don’t actually know what a positive or negative experience is. Some of the most difficult and stressful moments of our lives also end up being the most formative and motivating. Some of the best and most gratifying experiences of our lives are also the most distracting and demotivating. Don’t trust your conception of positive/negative experiences. ([Location 1690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1690))
    - Note: Could be the best part of this book.
- In this way, “knowing yourself” or “finding yourself” can be dangerous. It can cement you into a strict role and saddle you with unnecessary expectations. It can close you off to inner potential and outer opportunities. I say don’t find yourself. I say never know who you are. Because that’s what keeps you striving and discovering. And it forces you to remain humble in your judgments and accepting of the differences in others. ([Location 1857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1857))
- Aristotle wrote, “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.” ([Location 1917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1917))
- That’s simply reality: if it feels like it’s you versus the world, chances are it’s really just you versus yourself. ([Location 1953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1953))
- making money, by itself, was a lousy metric for myself. You could make plenty of money and be miserable, just as you could be broke and be pretty happy. Therefore, why use money as a means to measure my self-worth? ([Location 1973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1973))
    - Note: 找到衡量自我价值实现程度的标尺。
- If someone is better than you at something, then it’s likely because she has failed at it more than you have. If someone is worse than you, it’s likely because he hasn’t been through all of the painful learning experiences you have. ([Location 1995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=1995))
- We can be truly successful only at something we’re willing to fail at. If we’re unwilling to fail, then we’re unwilling to succeed. ([Location 2006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2006))
- Anywhere there is an unhealthy or toxic relationship, there will be a poor and porous sense of responsibility on both sides, and there will be an inability to give and/or receive rejection. Wherever there is a healthy and loving relationship, there will be clear boundaries between the two people and their values, and there will be an open avenue of giving and receiving rejection when necessary. ([Location 2304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2304))
    - Note: 健康关系：对自己负责，有边界感，能够拒绝。
- People with strong boundaries understand that it’s unreasonable to expect two people to accommodate each other 100 percent and fulfill every need the other has. People with strong boundaries understand that they may hurt someone’s feelings sometimes, but ultimately they can’t determine how other people feel. People with strong boundaries understand that a healthy relationship is not about controlling one another’s emotions, but rather about each partner supporting the other in their individual growth and in solving their own problems. ([Location 2380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2380))
- When trust is destroyed, it can be rebuilt only if the following two steps happen: 1) the trust-breaker admits the true values that caused the breach and owns up to them, and 2) the trust-breaker builds a solid track record of improved behavior over time. ([Location 2437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2437))
- We are so materially well off, yet so psychologically tormented in so many low-level and shallow ways. People relinquish ([Location 2702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2702))
- Bukowski once wrote, “We’re all going to die, all of us. What a circus! That alone should make us love each other, but it doesn’t. We are terrorized and flattened by life’s trivialities; we are eaten up by nothing.” ([Location 2718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019MMUA8S&location=2718))
