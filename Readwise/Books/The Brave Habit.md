- Summary: "The Brave Habit" by Todd Henry is a guide to developing the habit of bravery in everyday moments. Bravery is not a personality trait but a decision that can be trained through practice. The book distinguishes between bravery and heroism, with bravery being the active form of courage that can be deployed in the moment of need. The conditions for bravery include having a vision for a better future and a belief in one's ability to act in the face of uncertainty.

## Highlights
- No one aspires to cowardice, yet many still choose it every day. They fail to speak up because they’re afraid of being wrong. They take the easier, more comfortable path instead of the one that could lead to immense return on their effort. They join the crowd instead of standing firm against the populist tide. They justify their cowardice as prudence.
  And that’s the funny thing about cowardice: it often comes disguised as wisdom. No one chooses to be a coward, or at least they don’t call it that. They argue that they are doing the most practical thing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnpzjgdsj69ajg7fysawvwjr))
- Cowards aren’t considered trust-worthy because cowardice is choosing self-protection over  doing the right thing. This means selling out your deeper aspirations for the sake of comfort, ease, and temporary reprieve from the uncertainty of the moment.
  Cowardice is the very definition of selfishness, whereas bravery is self-less. While someone may appear brave to observers, if their actions are rooted in self-protection and selfish ambition, they may simply be acting boldly, but not bravely. Saying big words and making bold moves isn’t necessarily brave if it’s only to serve yourself.
  And, this is why we don’t trust cowards. We never know when their self-interests may become misaligned from ours and they’ll throw us under the bus in order to protect themselves. They are not deemed worthy of trust, and even if we might find some alliance with them for a season of pursuing common ambitions, we are under no illusion that they are actually an ally.

- bravery is a discipline rather than an inevitable outcome.
  Bravery is not a personality trait, it’s a decision you make. And, like any difficult thing that we choose to do in life, our capacity for acting bravely in important moments can be developed like a muscle. By practicing brave decisions in smaller, less consequential moments we train ourselves to be ready to act bravely when the stakes are higher.

- nothing you do or choose happens in isolation. In fact, almost every action you take or choice you make has a lingering impact on the world around you, and over time the impacts of those actions are exponential. There are people you will never meet who will be impacted by the choices you make.
  An old proverb states that “A society grows great when old men (or women) plant trees in whose shade they know they will never sit.” I would amend this proverb to say “A community achieves its potential when each person acts as if their choices have a permanent and lasting impact.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnq0fdjg614gkaqew65ekxtm))
