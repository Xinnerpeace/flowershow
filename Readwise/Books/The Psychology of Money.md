## Highlights
- “A genius is the man who can do the average thing when everyone else around him is losing his mind.” —Napoleon ([Location 24](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=24))
- doing well with money has a little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. ([Location 41](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=41))
- Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming. ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=379))
- Studying a specific person can be dangerous because we tend to study extreme examples—the ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=386))
- people who have control over their time tend to be happier in life ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=392))
- When things are going extremely well, realize it’s not as good as you think. You are not invincible, and if you acknowledge that luck brought you success then you have to believe in luck’s cousin, risk, which can turn your story around just as quickly. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=398))
- Warren Buffett later put it: To make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked what they did have and did need. And that’s foolish. It is just plain foolish. If you risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you, it just does not make any sense. There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don’t have and don’t need. ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=459))
- If expectations rise with results there is no logic in striving for more because you’ll feel the same after putting in extra effort. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=468))
- Modern capitalism is a pro at two things: generating wealth and generating envy. Perhaps they go hand in hand; wanting to surpass your peers can be the fuel of hard work. But life isn’t any fun without a sense of enough. Happiness, as it’s said, is just results minus expectations. ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=471))
- Compounding doesn’t rely on earning big returns. Merely good returns sustained uninterrupted for the longest period of time—especially in times of chaos and havoc—will always win. ([Location 684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=684))
- Here’s the most important part of this story: The Russell 3000 has increased more than 73-fold since 1980. That is a spectacular return. That is success. Forty percent of the companies in the index were effectively failures. But the 7% of components that performed extremely well were more than enough to offset the duds. ([Location 796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=796))
- Napoleon’s definition of a military genius was, “The man who can do the average thing when all those around him are going crazy.” It’s the same in investing. ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=809))
- Our hit ratio is way too high right now. I’m always pushing the content team. We have to take more risk. You have to try more crazy things, because we should have a higher cancel rate overall. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=848))
- The Chris Rock I see on TV is hilarious, flawless. The Chris Rock that performs in dozens of small clubs each year is just OK. That is by design. No comedic genius is smart enough to preemptively know what jokes will land well. Every big comedian tests their material in small clubs before using it in big venues. Rock was once asked if he missed small clubs. He responded: When I start a tour, it’s not like I start out in arenas. Before this last tour I performed in this place in New Brunswick called the Stress Factory. I did about 40 or 50 shows getting ready for the tour.

- “It’s not whether you’re right or wrong that’s important,” George Soros once said, “but how much money you make when you’re right and how much you lose when you’re wrong.” You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune. ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=869))
- People like to feel like they’re in control—in the drivers’ seat. When we try to get them to do something, they feel disempowered. Rather than feeling like they made the choice, they feel like we made it for them. So they say no or do something else, even when they might have originally been happy to go along. ([Location 908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=908))
- Compared to generations prior, control over your time has diminished. And since controlling your time is such a key happiness influencer, we shouldn’t be surprised that people don’t feel much happier even though we are, on average, richer than ever. ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=960))
- Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays. ([Location 972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=972))
- “You might think you want an expensive car, a fancy watch, and a huge house. But I’m telling you, you don’t. What you want is respect and admiration from other people, and you think having expensive stuff will bring it. It almost never does—especially from the people you want to respect and admire you.” ([Location 983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=983))
- When most people say they want to be a millionaire, what they might actually mean is “I’d like to spend a million dollars.” And that is literally the opposite of being a millionaire. ([Location 1016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1016))
- Learning to be happy with less money creates a gap between what you have and what you want. ([Location 1083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1083))
- one of the most powerful ways to increase your savings isn’t to raise your income. It’s to raise your humility. ([Location 1096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1096))
- People with enduring personal finance success—not necessarily those with high incomes—tend to have a propensity to not give a damn what others think about them. ([Location 1099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1099))
- Savings without a spending goal gives you options and flexibility, the ability to wait and the opportunity to pounce. It gives you time to think. It lets you change course on your own terms. Every bit of savings is like taking a point in the future that would have been owned by someone else and giving it back to yourself. ([Location 1112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1112))
    - Note: 避免合理化 消费占收入比例, 不要以为 花少了是委屈自己.
- When you don’t have control over your time, you’re forced to accept whatever bad luck is thrown your way. But if you have flexibility you have the time to wait for no-brainer opportunities to fall in your lap. This is a hidden return on your savings. ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1120))
- It’s hard to wake up in the morning telling yourself you have no clue what the future holds, even if it’s true. Acting on investment forecasts is dangerous. But I get why people try to predict what will happen next year. It’s human nature. It’s reasonable. ([Location 1240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1240))
- History helps us calibrate our expectations, study where people tend to go wrong, and offers a rough guide of what tends to work. ([Location 1253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1253))
- Nassim Taleb writes in his book Fooled By Randomness: In Pharaonic Egypt … scribes tracked the high-water mark of the Nile and used it as an estimate for a future worst-case scenario. The same can be seen in the Fukushima nuclear reactor, which experienced a catastrophic failure in 2011 when a tsunami struck. It had been built to withstand the worst past historical earthquake, with the builders not imagining much worse—and not thinking that the worst past event had to be a surprise, as it had no precedent. ([Location 1310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1310))
- The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is surprising. Not that we should use past surprises as a guide to future boundaries; that we should use past surprises as an admission that we have no idea what might happen next. ([Location 1320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1320))
- We must make sure that we have enough money to withstand any swings of bad luck. ([Location 1412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1412))
- Room for error lets you endure a range of potential outcomes, and endurance lets you stick around long enough to let the odds of benefiting from a low-probability outcome fall in your favor. ([Location 1441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1441))
- Use room for error when estimating your future returns. This is more art than science. ([Location 1465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1465))
- The idea is that you have to take risk to get ahead, but no risk that can wipe you out is ever worth taking. The odds are in your favor when playing Russian roulette. But the downside is not worth the potential upside. There is no margin of safety that can compensate for the risk. ([Location 1473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1473))
- the cost of the downside is ruin, the upside the other 95% of the time likely isn’t worth the risk, no matter how appealing it looks. ([Location 1477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1477))
- Leverage is the devil here. Leverage—taking on debt to make your money go further—pushes routine risks into something capable of producing ruin. The danger is that rational optimism most of the time masks the odds of ruin some of the time. The result is we systematically underestimate risk. ([Location 1478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1478))
- I just want to ensure I can remain standing long enough for my risks to pay off. You have to survive to succeed. ([Location 1485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1485))
- You can plan for every risk except the things that are too crazy to cross your mind. And those crazy things can do the most harm, because they happen more often than you think and you have no plan for how to deal with them. ([Location 1497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1497))
- A good rule of thumb for a lot of things in life is that everything that can break will eventually break. So if many things rely on one thing working, and that thing breaks, you are counting the days to catastrophe. That’s a single point of failure. ([Location 1512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1512))
- The End of History Illusion is what psychologists call the tendency for people to be keenly aware of how much they’ve changed in the past, but to underestimate how much their personalities, desires, and goals are likely to change in the future. ([Location 1555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1555))
- Part of the reason people like Ronald Read—the wealthy janitor we met earlier in the book—and Warren Buffett become so successful is because they kept doing the same thing for decades on end, letting compounding run wild. But many of us evolve so much over a lifetime that we don’t want to keep doing the same thing for decades on end. ([Location 1567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1567))
- Compounding works best when you can give a plan years or decades to grow. This is true for not only savings but careers and relationships. Endurance is key. And when you consider our tendency to change who we are over time, balance at every point in your life becomes a strategy to avoid future regret and encourage endurance. ([Location 1581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1581))
- Growth is driven by compounding, which always takes time. Destruction is driven by single points of failure, which can happen in seconds, and loss of confidence, which can happen in an instant. ([Location 1927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1927))
- And in careers, where reputations take a lifetime to build and a single email to destroy. ([Location 1941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1941))
- There are many things in life that we think are true because we desperately want them to be true. ([Location 1992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1992))
