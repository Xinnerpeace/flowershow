- Summary: "The Communist Manifesto" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels outlines the history and struggles of the bourgeoisie and working class, or proletariat, during the development of modern industrial society. The document argues that the bourgeoisie, or capitalist class, has created its own "grave diggers" in the form of the proletarian class, and that the two groups are in constant conflict. The manifesto proposes that the proletariat must unite and overthrow the bourgeoisie, leading to the establishment of a classless society where the free development of individuals is the condition for the free development of all. The document also critiques other forms of socialism, such as Utopian and petty-bourgeois socialism.

## Highlights
- the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnevp4b2ptqechwgnerj2m90))
